# 8-Bit-ALU
8 Bit ALU using logic gates only

Implemented a fully functioning ALU using add, sub, slt, And, Or, NAND, NOR, Zero, Overflow

The circuit includes:

        1-bit adder
        2-1 Multiplexer 
        2-4 Decoder
        4-2 Multiplexer
        1-bit ALU
        XOR logic Gate - takes care of overflow
